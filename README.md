## CryptoKitties Polka VM

CryptoKitties PolkaVM Port is a Web3 project that brings the iconic Ethereum-based decentralized application, CryptoKitties, to the Polkadot ecosystem using PolkaVM. This port replicates the core mechanics of the original dApp, including **kitty creation, breeding, and auctions**, while adapting the smart contracts to run seamlessly within the PolkaVM environment.

The project includes a full reimplementation of the Breeding and Auction contracts in a Substrate-compatible format, ensuring feature parity and performance on Polkadot's virtual machine. It has been tested extensively on the **Westend Testnet**, demonstrating compatibility, efficiency, and the feasibility of running legacy Ethereum dApps on PolkaVM.

By bridging Ethereum's dApp legacy with Polkadot's scalable and interoperable infrastructure, this project showcases how widely adopted smart contract applications can evolve beyond the EVM, unlocking new cross-chain potential while maintaining familiar user experiences.
